## Dava's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! Here I maintain my custom configuration for my Arch Linux setup.

Here you'll find:  

* **Basic, Yet Efficient Setups:** I tend to stick with most of the configuration as-is, with minimal changes. It's pretty basic, but that's exactly how I like it. Clean, straightforward, and efficient.
* **Perfect for Beginners:** If you're just starting out with Arch Linux, you might find my configurations super helpful. They're easy to understand and implement, making your journey into the world of Arch a bit smoother.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify anything you find here.

Happy configuring!
