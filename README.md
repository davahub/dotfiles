## Dava's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! Here I maintain my custom configuration for my Arch
Linux setup. I tend to stick with the defaults with minimal changes. It's
pretty basic, but that's exactly how I like it clean and straightforward.


If you're just starting with Arch Linux, you might find my configurations
helpful. They're easy to understand and implement, making your journey into the
world of Arch a bit smoother.


Feel free to explore, use, and modify anything you find here.

Happy configuring!

## How to setup the repository

There are many ways to manage your dotfiles. I personally just symlink my dotfiles using my own
script but you can use other better alternatives for this.

Other ways to manage dotfiles:  

* [bare git repo](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
* [utilities](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/)
