## Dava's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! Here I maintain my custom configuration for my Arch Linux setup.

Here you'll find:  

* **Basic, Yet Efficient Setups:** I tend to stick with most of the configuration as-is, with
  minimal changes. It's pretty basic, but that's exactly how I like it. Clean, straightforward, and
  efficient.
* **Perfect for Beginners:** If you're just starting with Arch Linux, you might find my
  configurations super helpful. They're easy to understand and implement, making your journey into
  the world of Arch a bit smoother.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify anything you find here.

Happy configuring!

## How to setup the repository

There are many ways to manage your dotfiles. I personally just symlink my dotfiles using my own
script but you can use other better alternatives for this.

Other ways to manage dotfiles:  

* [bare git repo](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
* [utilities](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/)
