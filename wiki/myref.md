### Contracting ###


#### Dividend ####

If your company has made a profit (the amount left after business expenses, liabilities and taxes), the remainder can be distributed to shareholders. Quite simple, dividends are an additional (and alternative) way of paying yourself from the profits available in the company.  

Each your you get a dividend allowance which means you can only take up to this amount. Some limited company shareholder receive a salary they draw from the company, with the remaining profits taken as a dividend payment as this does not attract National Insurance contributions. Company owners don't need to take all available fund from their company - they can leave the money within the company and make use of tax planning (we would advise speaking to an accountant about this).

Most contractors find paying themselves through a combination of salary, directors loans and dividends is the most tax-efficient way of drawing money from their limited company. Through this will vary depending on your unique circumstances, it's worth investigating the possibilities to find a combination which works for you.












### IR35 ###

It is a legislation introduced in 2000, and designed to do make sure workers and employers pay the right amount of employment taxes, that's aim to remove any differences between employed workers and the self-employed who are on the face of it undertaking similar work. It especially affects contractors or workers providing services through an intermediary personal service company (which is Limited Liability Company), also terms as disguise employment, or of Pierrot working rules these are all substitutes for ir35.  
Rules on who decides the IR35 status of an assignment introduced for the public sector in April 2017 are now due to be implemented in the public sector on 6th April 2020.


![ir35](images/ir35-diagram.png)

To put everything in a diagram, if you start on the left hand side you are going to look at the owner of a limited company or worker who's providing services through a personal services company there'll be a contract between the PSC and the end-user the client the engager and that could be an agency who sits between the end client and the personal service company, so there will be a contract for services, between the PSC and the end client. Now importantly HMRC will look for is the curve line between owner-worker and the end client they will take the personal service company out of the equation and look at what they call the hypothetical contract so how would that worker be assessed at the personal service company wasn't there, other carrying out the same duties as an employee would or are they in fact an independent contractor providing services to the end-client, so this is what HMRC seeks to do when they accesses any ir35 contact or working assignment.  
So why ir35 is important? in simple terms unemployed worker under a PEO a year in even pay more an income tax and national insurance than a self-employed contractor working through an intermediary that's very broad statement but in simple terms that's the situation. End-client pays national insurance for every employee at 13.8% and it doesn't pay any national insurance as an employer for a worker who is self-employed. Thinking about from the contractors perspective they could extract a profit from the limited company using any tax efficient combination of salary and dividends they like, they build up significant profit and the limited company for future.


**Exceptions**  
The end-client not the PSC will determine the IR35 status of an assignment.  
Private sector end-client who are considered to be **small** won't be affected by the changes - if they meet 2 of the following criteria.  
* Annual turnover less than £10.2 million
* Balance sheet total less than £5.1 million
* Less than 50 employees

There won't be any exemption for the public sector.


**How End-Client works**  

The end-client is responsible for issuing a Status Determination Statement(SDS) which must include the:  
* Worker's employment status following an IR35 assessment
* Reasons for reaching the employment status conclusion  

The end client is responsible for the deduction and payment all employment taxes (income tax, Employee NI and Employers NI).  

Where an Agency is involved in the labour supply chain and is the **fee-payer**, the Agency is responsible for deduction and payment of all employment taxes. 5% expenses allowance for PSCs removed for all assignments.

### History ###

#### Jan Baalsrud ####

Jan Sigurd Baalsrud (13 December 1917 - 30 December 1988) was a commando in Norwegian resistance trained by the British during World War II. During this time he embarked mission to destory a German air control tower at Bardufoss called "Operation Martin" was compromised when Baalsrud and his fellow soldiers, seeking a trusted Resistance contact, accidentally made contact with an unaligned civilian shopkeeper with same name who betrayed them to the Germans. The morning after their blunder on March 29, their fishin boat Bratholm containing 8 tons of explosives intended to destroy the air control tower was attached by a German vessel. The Norwegians scuttled their boat by detonating the 8 tons of explosive using a time delay fuse and fled in a small boat however the small boat was promply sunk by the Germans. They swam accross ice cold Arctic waters, baalsrud was the only commando to evade capture and soaking wet and missing one sea boot, he escaped up into a snow gully where he shot and killed a German Gestapo officer with his pistol. he evaded capture for approximately two months suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. His deteriorating physical condition forced him to rely on the assistance of Norwegian patriots. During this time he stayed in a wooden hut at Revdal which he called Hotel Savoy, he was forced to operate on his legs with a pocket knife, he blood poisoning and that drawing the blood out would help.


#### Poems ####


##### Wise words #####


To cry over others' misfortunes,  
To rejoice over others' happiness,  
To love,  
To get angry...  
Isn't that what it means to “live” ??


Because we were weak alone,  
Together, we swore to become stronger...  


If you are anything more than a minimum wage drone, be aware that the workplace is shark infested waters. Sharks sometimes "swim together" and even appear to "work together" to a limited extent...but they are still sharks. One shark doesn't care a bit if the next one gets their "fair share", and one shark will as happily eat the other shark if it is to their advantage at the moment. Sharks have no remorse and no loyalty. It is ALL about "what am I going to eat today". The career world is the same.



##### Other poems #####
Your skin isn't paper, don't cut it
Your face isn't a mask, don't cover it
Your body isn't a book, dont judge it
Your life isn't a movie, don't end it
Your heart isn't a door, don't lock it
You're beautiful💓
