#### Jan Baalsrud ####

Jan Sigurd Baalsrud (13 December 1917 - 30 December 1988) was a commando in Norwegian resistance trained by the British during World War II. During this time he embarked mission to destory a German air control tower at Bardufoss called "Operation Martin" was compromised when Baalsrud and his fellow soldiers, seeking a trusted Resistance contact, accidentally made contact with an unaligned civilian shopkeeper with same name who betrayed them to the Germans. The morning after their blunder on March 29, their fishin boat Bratholm containing 8 tons of explosives intended to destroy the air control tower was attached by a German vessel. The Norwegians scuttled their boat by detonating the 8 tons of explosive using a time delay fuse and fled in a small boat however the small boat was promply sunk by the Germans. They swam accross ice cold Arctic waters, baalsrud was the only commando to evade capture and soaking wet and missing one sea boot, he escaped up into a snow gully where he shot and killed a German Gestapo officer with his pistol. he evaded capture for approximately two months suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. His deteriorating physical condition forced him to rely on the assistance of Norwegian patriots. During this time he stayed in a wooden hut at Revdal which he called Hotel Savoy, he was forced to operate on his legs with a pocket knife, he blood poisoning and that drawing the blood out would help.


#### Poems ####


##### Wise words #####


To cry over others' misfortunes,  
To rejoice over others' happiness,  
To love,  
To get angry...  
Isn't that what it means to ‚Äúlive‚Äù ??


Because we were weak alone,  
Together, we swore to become stronger...  


If you are anything more than a minimum wage drone, be aware that the workplace is shark infested waters. Sharks sometimes "swim together" and even appear to "work together" to a limited extent...but they are still sharks. One shark doesn't care a bit if the next one gets their "fair share", and one shark will as happily eat the other shark if it is to their advantage at the moment. Sharks have no remorse and no loyalty. It is ALL about "what am I going to eat today". The career world is the same.



##### Other poems #####
Your skin isn't paper, don't cut it
Your face isn't a mask, don't cover it
Your body isn't a book, dont judge it
Your life isn't a movie, don't end it
Your heart isn't a door, don't lock it
You're beautifulüíì
