### Contracting ###


#### Dividend ####

If your company has made a profit (the amount left after business expenses, liabilities and taxes), the remainder can be distributed to shareholders. Quite simple, dividends are an additional (and alternative) way of paying yourself from the profits available in the company.  

Each your you get a dividend allowance which means you can only take up to this amount. Some limited company shareholder receive a salary they draw from the company, with the remaining profits taken as a dividend payment as this does not attract National Insurance contributions. Company owners don't need to take all available fund from their company - they can leave the money within the company and make use of tax planning (we would advise speaking to an accountant about this).

Most contractors find paying themselves through a combination of salary, directors loans and dividends is the most tax-efficient way of drawing money from their limited company. Through this will vary depending on your unique circumstances, it's worth investigating the possibilities to find a combination which works for you.



### IR35 ###

It is a legislation introduced in 2000, and designed to do make sure workers and employers pay the right amount of employment taxes, that's aim to remove any differences between employed workers and the self-employed who are on the face of it undertaking similar work. It especially affects contractors or workers providing services through an intermediary personal service company (which is Limited Liability Company), also terms as disguise employment, or of Pierrot working rules these are all substitutes for ir35.  
Rules on who decides the IR35 status of an assignment introduced for the public sector in April 2017 are now due to be implemented in the public sector on 6th April 2020.


![ir35](images/ir35-diagram.png)

To put everything in a diagram, if you start on the left hand side you are going to look at the owner of a limited company or worker who's providing services through a personal services company there'll be a contract between the PSC and the end-user the client the engager and that could be an agency who sits between the end client and the personal service company, so there will be a contract for services, between the PSC and the end client. Now importantly HMRC will look for is the curve line between owner-worker and the end client they will take the personal service company out of the equation and look at what they call the hypothetical contract so how would that worker be assessed at the personal service company wasn't there, other carrying out the same duties as an employee would or are they in fact an independent contractor providing services to the end-client, so this is what HMRC seeks to do when they accesses any ir35 contact or working assignment.  
So why ir35 is important? in simple terms unemployed worker under a PEO a year in even pay more an income tax and national insurance than a self-employed contractor working through an intermediary that's very broad statement but in simple terms that's the situation. End-client pays national insurance for every employee at 13.8% and it doesn't pay any national insurance as an employer for a worker who is self-employed. Thinking about from the contractors perspective they could extract a profit from the limited company using any tax efficient combination of salary and dividends they like, they build up significant profit and the limited company for future.


**Exceptions**  
The end-client not the PSC will determine the IR35 status of an assignment.  
Private sector end-client who are considered to be **small** won't be affected by the changes - if they meet 2 of the following criteria.  
* Annual turnover less than £10.2 million
* Balance sheet total less than £5.1 million
* Less than 50 employees

There won't be any exemption for the public sector.


**How End-Client works**  

The end-client is responsible for issuing a Status Determination Statement(SDS) which must include the:  
* Worker's employment status following an IR35 assessment
* Reasons for reaching the employment status conclusion  

The end client is responsible for the deduction and payment all employment taxes (income tax, Employee NI and Employers NI).  

Where an Agency is involved in the labour supply chain and is the **fee-payer**, the Agency is responsible for deduction and payment of all employment taxes. 5% expenses allowance for PSCs removed for all assignments.

### Advanced Techniques in Daily Trading ###

* There are two trading styles, discretionary and mechanical systems based.
    - Discretionary traders evaluate potential trades based on their trading plan, although discretionary trader's rules are known, the trader decides to take or pass on trades based on their experience and doesn't follow a firm algorithm of entries and exits instead weigh all available information and then make a call.
    - Mechanical systems, on the other hand are strategies a computer program can execute, computer software using historical market data to determine positive expectancy. Institutional trading, high frequency trading and algorithms are all examples of mechanical systems based trading.
* In trading, you accept a loss, without questioning your strategy, you make another trade and you accept another loss, and in the third trade, when it works in your favor, you make sufficient money to cover your previous losses, if you are using a risk/reward ratio higher than 1:3 in the execution of your strategy.
* Mechanical aspect of trading - tools of the trade including scanners, software, hot-keys, brokers and chat-rooms news feeds and journaling. You platform (DAS Trader is one) is one of the most important tools in trading.
* Technical aspect - how to do trading and can be learned quickly. Some of the skills to be learned include building a watch-list, finding the Stocks in Play (finding the correct stocks to trade), identifying and practicing strategies, finding patterns, and learning about positions. 
* Psychological Aspect of Trading - is a secret to the nature of trading and most challenging aspect of trading. Some of the psychological pitfalls that beginners and even experienced traders can encounter include emotional trading, fear, greed, revenge trading, not knowing how to manage losses, and not being in an appropriate mindset. Many famous traders say it is 80% psychology and 20% technical knowledge because success of trading is based on psychology. There are number of psychology snares awaiting unwary trader. To be successful trader you must be self-disciplined and have excellent money management skill. As Dr. Alexander Elder mentioned everyday trader must treat this as important as scuba divers watch their supply of air.
* In financial market, simply better than average is not good enough, you have to be significantly above the crowd to win in day trading, trading is minus-sum game, just by entering into the market you start losing.
* You bank charges you a fee for wiring out to fund your trading account, your broker will charge you an incoming wiring fee for funding the account and then start charging you for their market data, the use of their platform and a commission on each trade that you make. If you do not make enough monthly commissions for them, they will then charge you an inactivity fee. Regulators such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as the actual exchanges, also live off of the markets by charging fees.
* Day trading often appeals to impulsive people, gamblers and those who feel that the world owes them a living, **you cannot be one of them** and you should not act like them. Winners feels and act differently than losers, and this will reflect in all aspects of your life. You must look within yourself and your life, discard your illusions, and change your old ways of being, thinking and acting. Change is hard but it has to happen to become a successful trader. Day trading is not a hobby or weekend pursuit, once you start trading with real money, you need to treat it as your job, as your career and as your profession. You must start developing the discipline of a winner and can't be casual about it. A significant part of success is how to control your emotions.
* Fear is nature's way of responding to a threat and in trading it can undo the best of intentions. It is an emotion that can affect not only beginners, but veteran traders as well, at one extreme it can result in paralysis inability to make decisions. While risk-taking in trading needs to be carefully and rationally managed, an excessive avoidance of risk can be a major roadblock to success.
* Full-service brokers are usually well-suited for investors and retail swing traders, but due to lack of speed execution, they are not a good choice for day traders. **Direct-access** brokers are the answer to trading get in and out of trades in a matter of a few seconds.
* Inexperienced traders may find it difficult to become familiar with direct-access trading. Knowledge is required when dealing with processes and procedures such as making trade decisions and order routing. That is why I always recommend traders practice in their broker's simulator platform and ensure they are very familiar with the platform before opening real account. Direct access trading you are one one click away from making dangerous mistake and blowing up your account, while if you are full-service brokerage, the agent may catch your mistake or advice you before executing your order. Note that recently many brokerage firms have begun to offer both direct-access and full-service services (such as advice and research), so it is best to check their websites and inquire about their services.
* Electronic online trading platform is a computer software program that is used to place orders for day trading. Trading platform is different from the direct-access brokers themselves. However, I see of ten that traders confuse these two as one. Trading platform sends and places your order at the exchange so your direct-access broker can clear the order for you. Usually, direct-access brokers offer their own proprietary trading platform to their clients. The quality, charting, capability, speed of the software and many other features regarding the software, varies significantly, which also of course affects their pricing.
* Interactive Brokers offers a trading platform called Trader Workstation (TWS), but it also allows you to use the DAS Trader platform. Lightspeed Trading also offers its own platform called Lightspeed Trader. TD Ameritrade's own software is called thinkorswim. CenterPoint Securities uses DAS Trader as its platform. Table below summarizes some of the well-known direct-access brokers for day trading. Prefers CenterPoint Securities

### History ###

#### Jan Baalsrud ####

Jan Sigurd Baalsrud (13 December 1917 - 30 December 1988) was a commando in Norwegian resistance trained by the British during World War II. During this time he embarked mission to destory a German air control tower at Bardufoss called "Operation Martin" was compromised when Baalsrud and his fellow soldiers, seeking a trusted Resistance contact, accidentally made contact with an unaligned civilian shopkeeper with same name who betrayed them to the Germans. The morning after their blunder on March 29, their fishin boat Bratholm containing 8 tons of explosives intended to destroy the air control tower was attached by a German vessel. The Norwegians scuttled their boat by detonating the 8 tons of explosive using a time delay fuse and fled in a small boat however the small boat was promply sunk by the Germans. They swam accross ice cold Arctic waters, baalsrud was the only commando to evade capture and soaking wet and missing one sea boot, he escaped up into a snow gully where he shot and killed a German Gestapo officer with his pistol. he evaded capture for approximately two months suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. His deteriorating physical condition forced him to rely on the assistance of Norwegian patriots. During this time he stayed in a wooden hut at Revdal which he called Hotel Savoy, he was forced to operate on his legs with a pocket knife, he blood poisoning and that drawing the blood out would help.


#### Poems ####


##### Wise words #####


To cry over others' misfortunes,  
To rejoice over others' happiness,  
To love,  
To get angry...  
Isn't that what it means to “live” ??


Because we were weak alone,  
Together, we swore to become stronger...  


If you are anything more than a minimum wage drone, be aware that the workplace is shark infested waters. Sharks sometimes "swim together" and even appear to "work together" to a limited extent...but they are still sharks. One shark doesn't care a bit if the next one gets their "fair share", and one shark will as happily eat the other shark if it is to their advantage at the moment. Sharks have no remorse and no loyalty. It is ALL about "what am I going to eat today". The career world is the same.



##### Other poems #####
Your skin isn't paper, don't cut it
Your face isn't a mask, don't cover it
Your body isn't a book, dont judge it
Your life isn't a movie, don't end it
Your heart isn't a door, don't lock it
You're beautiful💓
